# Voice Toggle Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a voice toggle functionality to the hexa application with a glassy overlay effect. The feature allows users to enable/disable voice interaction with the animated hexagon.

## Components Added

### 1. HexagonContainer (`src/components/HexagonContainer.tsx`)

A wrapper component that provides:
- **Toggle Button**: Centered above the hexagon with animated indicator
- **Glassy Overlay**: Semi-transparent overlay with blur effect when voice is disabled
- **Status Display**: Shows current voice state below the hexagon
- **Smooth Animations**: All state changes are animated using Framer Motion

### 2. Animation Store Updates (`src/store/animationStore.ts`)

Added new state management:
- `isVoiceDisabled: boolean` - Controls voice functionality
- `setVoiceDisabled(disabled: boolean)` - Toggle function
- `VoiceState` type extended with `'disabled'` state

### 3. AnimatedHexagon Integration (`src/components/animated/AnimatedHexagon.tsx`)

Updated to respect voice disabled state:
- Blocks voice interaction when disabled
- Updates cursor and hover states
- Shows appropriate status icons and colors
- Provides helpful tooltips

## Features

### Visual Behavior

**When Voice is OFF:**
- Glassy, frosted overlay covers the hexagon
- Disabled icon (ðŸ”‡) appears in the center
- Status shows "Voice: OFF" in gray
- Hexagon is not interactive (cursor changes to not-allowed)
- Subtle pulse effect on the overlay border

**When Voice is ON:**
- Overlay disappears completely
- Status shows "Voice: ON" in green
- Hexagon is fully interactive
- Button shows pulsing indicator
- Normal voice functionality restored

### Technical Details

- **State Management**: Uses Zustand store for global state
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassy effects
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing voice system

## Usage

The `HexagonContainer` component automatically wraps the `AnimatedHexagon` and provides the toggle functionality. No additional configuration is required.

```tsx
<HexagonContainer size={300} />
```

## Implementation Notes

- The voice disabled state is stored globally in the animation store
- The overlay uses `backdrop-filter: blur()` for the glassy effect
- All animations respect the user's motion preferences
- The component is fully responsive and accessible
- Voice functionality is completely blocked when disabled (no recording, no processing)

## Future Enhancements

- Add keyboard shortcuts for toggle (e.g., Space key)
- Persist voice state across sessions
- Add sound effects for toggle actions
- Customizable overlay styles
- Voice state indicators in the UI
