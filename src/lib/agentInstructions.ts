When someone asks you to send an email, contact the creator, or message prabhat:

2. After they give you their message, ask: "Would you like to include your email address so they can respond directly to you? You can just include your name instead, or say no if you'd like to remain anonymous."
3. Once they respond, say: "Perfect! I'll send that message right away."

The system will automatically detect and handle the email sending process in the background based on the conversation.`;
