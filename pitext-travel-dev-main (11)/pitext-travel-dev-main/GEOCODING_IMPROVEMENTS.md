# Geocoding Improvements

This document describes the enhanced geocoding system implemented in `pitext_travel/api/geocoding.py` to ensure better city-scoped address resolution and eliminate cross-city mixups.

## Overview

The geocoding improvements implement a multi-layered approach to ensure that places are correctly geocoded within their intended city context:

1. **City-Scoped Addressing** - Always include the city in geocoding queries
2. **Component Filtering** - Use Google's components parameter to confine results
3. **Result Validation** - Verify that results are actually in the target city
4. **Enhanced Caching** - Cache results with city context for better performance

## Key Functions

### `geocode_with_city_scope(place, city, country)`

The core function that implements city-scoped geocoding with component filtering.

```python
def geocode_with_city_scope(place: str, city: str, country: str = "") -> Optional[tuple[float, float]]:
    """Geocode a place with city-scoped addressing and component filtering."""
```

**Features:**
- Builds queries like `"Eiffel Tower, Paris"` instead of just `"Eiffel Tower"`
- Uses component filtering: `"locality:Paris|country:FR"`
- Validates results against target city
- Returns coordinates only if validation passes

### `validate_city_match(result, target_city)`

Validates that a geocoding result matches the target city by examining address components.

```python
def validate_city_match(result: Dict[str, Any], target_city: str) -> bool:
    """Validate that a geocoding result matches the target city."""
```

**Validation Logic:**
- Extracts all locality names from `address_components`
- Checks for exact matches (case-insensitive)
- Handles partial matches (e.g., "Prayagraj" vs "Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh")
- Logs mismatches for debugging

### `get_coordinates_for_place_with_context()`

Enhanced version that tries multiple geocoding strategies in order:

1. City-scoped geocoding with component filtering
2. Location-biased search (if coordinates available)
3. Traditional geocoding with city name
4. Fallback to basic geocoding

### `batch_geocode_places()`

Efficiently geocodes multiple places with enhanced caching:

```python
def batch_geocode_places(places: List[str], city: str = "", 
                        city_lat: Optional[float] = None, city_lng: Optional[float] = None,
                        country: str = "") -> Dict[str, tuple[float, float]]:
```

**Features:**
- City-aware caching (different cache keys for different cities)
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging

## Usage Examples

### Basic City-Scoped Geocoding

```python
from pitext_travel.api.geocoding import geocode_with_city_scope

# Geocode a place in Paris
coords = geocode_with_city_scope("Eiffel Tower", "Paris", "FR")
if coords:
    lat, lng = coords
    print(f"Found at {lat}, {lng}")
```

### Batch Geocoding for Itinerary

```python
from pitext_travel.api.geocoding import batch_geocode_places

places = ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre Museum", "Notre-Dame Cathedral"]
results = batch_geocode_places(places, "Paris", country="FR")

for place, coords in results.items():
    print(f"{place}: {coords}")
```

### Itinerary Enhancement

```python
from pitext_travel.api.geocoding import enhance_itinerary_with_geocoding

# Enhance itinerary with geocoding
enhanced_itinerary = enhance_itinerary_with_geocoding(
    itinerary_data, 
    city="Paris", 
    country="FR"
)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Required for all geocoding operations

### Component Filtering

The system supports component filtering for better accuracy:

```python
# For India
coords = geocode_with_city_scope("Taj Mahal", "Agra", "IN")

# For United States  
coords = geocode_with_city_scope("Central Park", "New York", "US")

# For France
coords = geocode_with_city_scope("Eiffel Tower", "Paris", "FR")
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API Errors**: Logs HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Validation Failures**: Logs city mismatches with details
- **Timeouts**: Handles network timeouts gracefully
- **Missing Results**: Logs when no results are found

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- **City-Aware Caching**: Different cache keys for different cities
- **LRU Cache**: Automatic eviction of least recently used entries
- **Cache Size**: Configurable cache size (default: 1000 entries)

### Batch Processing

- **Efficient Batching**: Processes multiple places in single function calls
- **Reduced API Calls**: Minimizes API requests through intelligent caching
- **Parallel Processing**: Ready for future async implementation

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the improvements:

```bash
python test_geocoding_improvements.py
```

The test script demonstrates:
- City-scoped geocoding with different cities
- Batch geocoding efficiency
- Itinerary enhancement
- Validation function testing

## Benefits

### Accuracy Improvements

1. **Eliminates Cross-City Mixups**: Places are guaranteed to be in the target city
2. **Better Context**: Uses city and country information for more accurate results
3. **Validation**: Double-checks results against expected city

### Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Intelligent caching reduces redundant requests
2. **Faster Processing**: Batch operations are more efficient
3. **Better Hit Rates**: City-aware caching improves cache utilization

### Reliability

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to simpler methods if advanced features fail
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring
3. **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even if individual places fail

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

The enhanced functions are backward compatible. Existing code will continue to work:

```python
# Old code (still works)
coords = get_coordinates_for_place_with_context(place, city_lat, city_lng)

# New code (recommended)
coords = get_coordinates_for_place_with_context(place, city, city_lat, city_lng, country)
```

### New Features

To take advantage of the new features:

1. **Add city parameter** to function calls
2. **Include country code** for better accuracy
3. **Use batch functions** for multiple places
4. **Monitor logs** for validation results

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. **Async Support**: Non-blocking geocoding operations
2. **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API rate limiting
3. **Alternative Providers**: Fallback to other geocoding services
4. **Machine Learning**: Learn from successful/failed geocoding attempts
5. **Place Autocomplete**: Frontend integration with Google Places Autocomplete

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**: Ensure `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set and valid
2. **City Mismatches**: Check logs for validation failures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor API usage and implement delays if needed
4. **Network Issues**: Check timeout settings and network connectivity

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed geocoding information:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('pitext_travel.api.geocoding').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

This will show:
- API requests and responses
- Validation results
- Cache hits and misses
- Distance calculations
